In 2020, Bel offices in Suresnes were closed for 2 months due to COVID-19 pandemic and French lockdown measures. Anticipating that the reopening of offices would be subject to the capacity of Bel to respect social distancing measures, IT developed an app to monitor office attendance.

Bel Come Back allows employees to configure their working days (select the days they want to come, specify if they need to park their car and select a timeslot for the canteen), check in/out of public spaces and read barrier gestures.

The Progressive Web app is provided with dedicated back office that allows HR and Facility Managers to adapt Bel Come Back to their needs. They can manage quotas and emergency contacts, know which employees will be and have been on site and analyze attendance.
